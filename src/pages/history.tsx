              “We will be a team of devils. Our colours will be red like fire
              and black to invoke fear in our opponents!” These were the words
              that Herbert Kilpin used as he founded AC Milan on 16 December
              1899. Just a year and a half later, the Rossoneri became the
              champions of Italy for the first time after beating Genoa 3-0 at
              Ponte Carrega on 5 May 1901.
            </p>
            <p>
              The first celebration took place at AC Milans first headquarters,
              the Fiaschetteria Toscana on Via Berchet in Milan, in 1899. Words,
              places and dates that gave rise to the Rossoneri’s glorious
              history. This is a Club that has contributed hugely to the world
              of football, so much so that AC Milan held the most international
              titles recognised by FIFA from December 2007 to February 2014.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Rossoneri’s history is now the stuff of legend, as are the men
              who have helped to write it – be they presidents, coaches or
              footballers. There have been so many historic figures, from the
              Englishman Alfred Edwards, under whom the Club won its first
              league title, and Andrea Rizzoli, the first President of AC Milan
              and an Italian team to win the European Cup in 1963 at Wembley,
              through to Silvio Berlusconi, the President who had the most
              success in Italy, Europe and throughout the world.

              It is also possible to recognise a great club through its playing
              culture in particular, by the style it promotes, by the way it
              carries itself, by the innovative drive given to it by its
              leaders. It’s no coincidence that various Rossoneri victories over
              various eras and different decades have brought about new visions
              about how football should be played. And those sitting on the AC
              Milan bench have been key to this: the greatest coaches of Italian
              football have all taken charge of the Rossoneri. Gipo Viani, Nereo
              Rocco and Nils Liedholm paved the way for Arrigo Sacchi, Fabio
              Capello and Carlo Ancelotti, the latter trio inheriting incredible
              legacies while looking to play a modern, spectacular brand of
              football.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the historic years under Berlusconis presidency, Arrigo
              Sacchi was hugely successful and innovated not only thanks to
              great players, but also thanks to what could be considered as an
              extra man: the Game he played. Fabio Capello then took over,
              providing continuity as the winning culture continued. Under
              Sacchi, AC Milan won one Scudetto, two European Cups, two European
              Super Cups and two Intercontinental Cups, winning all the
              international finals they were involved in. And it was that extra
              man, the Game, that brought the best out of individuals and led to
              three Rossoneri players occupying the top three places in the
              Ballon d’Or in 1988 (Van Basten, Gullit and Rijkaard) and 1989
              (Van Basten, Baresi and Rijkaard).

              Under Capello, AC Milan were the dominant team in Italy, winning
              four Scudetti in five seasons. However, success wasnt just limited
              to what they did at home, the team also remained a force to be
              reckoned with in Europe. The Rossoneri made it to three
              consecutive Champions League finals between 1993 and 1995, with
              the 1994 success in Athens against Barcelona being voted as the
              ‘Match of the Century by AC Milan fans in the Club’s Centenary
              referendum. Such was the strength of the Rossoneri with Don Fabio
              at the helm, the team went 58 games unbeaten between May 1991 and
              March 1993, while Sebastiano Rossi went 929 minutes without
              conceding a goal during the 1993/94 season. Furthermore, the
              Diavolo won three league titles between 1992 and 1994 without
              being given a single penalty.

              Following Capello’s tenure, and after the Scudetto title won by
              Alberto Zaccheroni in his first season at the Club and Fatih
              Terim’s brief spell, the mantle was passed on to Carlo Ancelotti,
              with the Italian looking to emulate the success of the Immortals
              (of Arrigo Sacchi), of which he was a part, and the Invincibles of
              Fabio Capello. With King Carlo at the helm, more space had to be
              cleared in the Rossoneri’s trophy cabinet. In five seasons,
              Ancelotti won two Champions League titles, also reaching the
              final, semi-finals and quarter-finals in three other European
              campaigns.

              In the 2009/10 season, Coach Ancelotti was replaced by Leonardo.
              He remained AC Milan Coach for a year after having spent 13 years
              at the Club, initially as a player, then as a director as part of
              AC Milans charity Fondazione Milan and also the technical sector.
              After Leonardo came Massimiliano Allegri, who had a fantastic team
              at his disposal for the 2010/11 season thanks to Ibrahimovic,
              Robinho and Boateng joining the Club in August 2010 and further
              reinforcements being added in January 2011. Under Coach Allegri,
              AC Milan won their 18th Scudetto and sixth Supercoppa Italiana,
              the latter of which was won against Inter in August 2011 at the
              Bird’s Nest in Beijing. After a further two and a half seasons,
              during which AC Milan finished second and third in Serie A,
              Clarence Seedorf took over the managerial hot-seat, another man
              who had previously shone in the Rossoneri shirt. Under Seedorf’s
              guidance, AC Milan picked up 35 points over the course of the
              second half of the 2013-2014 season.

              After previously scoring in all three of the Rossoneri’s 2007
              finals against Liverpool, Sevilla and Boca Juniors, Filippo
              Inzaghi took charge of the First Team in 2014/15. Prior to this,
              hed led the Primavera to Viareggio Cup success in February 2014.
              As for 2015/16, Sinisa Mihajlovic started the season in charge and
              guided the team to the Coppa Italia final before Cristian Brocchi
              was promoted from the Primavera to replace him by the end of the
              season.

              Come 2016/17, the Clubs hierarchy once again wanted to turn the
              page, duly appointing Vincenzo Montella as the Rossoneris new
              Coach. He subsequently guided the Rossoneri to Supercoppa Italiana
              success against Juventus on 23 December 2016 as Milan beat
              Juventus on penalties in Doha. Rino Gattuso was the next man to
              take the reins on 27 November 2017 – already a Rossoneri icon
              after winning 10 trophies with AC Milan from 2002 to 2011 (five in
              Italy and five on the international stage). The former Rossoneri
              midfielder guided the club to the Coppa Italia final and also
              ensured qualification to the Europa League on two separate
              occasions.

              The relationship between Gattuso and Casa Milan – which became the
              Rossoneris new Headquarters at the start of the 2013/14 campaign –
              ended mutually in May 2019. It was then down to the sporting
              hierarchy, made up of Zvonimir Boban and Paolo Maldini, to choose
              the club’s new Coach. They decided upon Marco Giampaolo, who made
              his Rossoneri debut this summer during the 2019 International
              Champions Cup. Our league campaign then got off to a slow start,
              and after three consecutive defeats to Inter, Torino and
              Fiorentina as well as a struggle to implement his new footballing
              philosophy, Marco Giampaolo left the Club.

              Stefano Pioli took over in his stead and did an excellent job in
              reforging the group and giving it a clear identity. Starting in
              June 2020, following the lockdown caused by the Covid-19 pandemic,
              the Rossoneri put together an important winning streak and managed
              to beat almost every opponent. The 2020/21 season was a rebirth
              for the Club, with the team performing extremely well in the
              league. AC Milan finished second on 79 points, having won 24
              matches and qualified for the Champions League for the first time
              in seven years. The high point of 2021/22 was winning Serie A, the
              perfect prize for an ambitious project. First place, 86 points, 26
              wins and 69 goals scored are just some of the numbers that
              contributed to AC Milan winning their 19th Scudetto.
